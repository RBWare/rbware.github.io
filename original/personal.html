            <p>The United States Constitution application was one of the first 2000 applications available on the Android platform. It arrived to the Android Market prior to the 1.5 launch and has undergone many revisions since that time. It uses the open source libraries ActionBarSherlock and HoloEverywhere to maintain compatibility with devices prior to Android 4.x (2.2+ is supported). The application was originally just a proof-of-concept for a college project but has been maintained with several updates since its original launch. The code is available for free to other developers who are interested in creating similar projects.</p>

          <p>Almy TV is designed to be a replacement launcher for Google's default Leanback Launcher. The major changes are to the areas where users can customize the layout of their installed applications. Users can add categories, and move applications between categories to better fit their individual preference. Advanced options include app sorting, custom backgrounds, true launcher replacement, Kodi integration, and more.</p>

          <p>Isopod is an app designed for podcast playback on Android TV. Some applications like TuneIn and Spotify allow listening to podcasts, but there were no apps specifically designed using Android TV's layout framework that did <b>only</b> podcast management. This application allows for playback, subscribing, downloading, and has many other tools and features commonly found in desktop and mobile apps.</p>

          </h5>
          <p>A lightweight application designed to allow the user to manage application information directly from Google Glass. As of version 2.0 of the Glass OS (a custom tailored version of Android), the only way to manage pre-installed applications was to connect the device via adb and manually use commands like <code>adb uninstall package_name</code>. The Glass App Manager implements a UI for this directly on the Glass hardware. Using a simple horizontal list, an application can be selected and with just a few taps several actions can be taken. The application allows you to "Force Stop", "Clear Data", "Clear Cache", and "Uninstall" without the need to ever connect to a computer. The application can be triggered by selection, or by saying, "Okay Glass, Uninstall an App."</p>

          <p>Photo Gallery application for Google Glass. This application solves the issue that as soon as a photo or video is taken, the user is only given a very brief moment to review what was captured before it is stored locally and no longer accessible. For some reason, as part of Google's decision with Glass, a photo or video can only be reviewed one time locally before it needs to be handed off to a computer or cloud service. With this application, the user can go back and review previously captured photo and video at their leisure. It also allows for a limited set of options like "Deleting", directly from the device. Without this application, users would be forced to attach glass via MicroUSB to their computer, and manually review and delete the content. This behavior was especially frustrating as the local storage started to fill up.</p>

          <p>A fork from a small project designed to allow for horizontal swiping on listview cells in order to reveal additional options. My fork was originally created as a solution to an issue in a RentPath project, but is freely available to those who want to use it. My changes are small tweaks that allow the items to be more extensible for developers.</p>

          <p>Lightweight application to reboot the Fire TV. Root access required. By default, there is no way, short of physically power-cycling the Fire TV for users to reboot the Amazon Fire TV. This application lets you "start" an application that reboots the FireTV programmatically.</p>

          <p>A small script designed to help solve a disconnect between Designers and Developers. When designers create assets for Android applications, it is generally done in an svg format. However, unlike iOS, Android does not natively handle SVG images. This script takes an SVG image as input and outputs android-compatible PNG images for densities LDPI through XXHDPI which saves time for designers as well devs.</p>
